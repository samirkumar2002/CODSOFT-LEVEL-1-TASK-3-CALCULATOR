# DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK PERFORMED

# üî¢ Basic Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## üìå Project Description

This project is a **simple web-based calculator** created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It performs basic arithmetic operations such as **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division**. This calculator is ideal for beginners who want to understand how to build interactive interfaces using fundamental front-end technologies.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the calculator layout.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsive grid-based button alignment.
- **JavaScript**: For handling logic, user interactions, and calculations.

---

## üí° Features

- Display screen to show inputs and results.
- Buttons for digits (0‚Äì9) and decimal point.
- Operators: Addition (+), Subtraction (‚àí), Multiplication (√ó), Division (√∑).
- Clear button (C) to reset input.
- Equal button (=) to compute the result.
- Grid-based layout using CSS for organized and aesthetic appearance.
- Input handling and evaluation using JavaScript.

---

## üß† How It Works

- User clicks buttons to form a mathematical expression.
- The value of each button is added to a string (`input`) using event listeners.
- On pressing the `=` button, the expression is evaluated using JavaScript's `eval()` function.
- Result is displayed on the screen.
- The `C` button clears the display and resets the input.

Basic error handling is included to prevent application crashes due to invalid inputs.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

This project helps learners:

- Understand DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.
- Use the CSS Grid system for responsive UI design.
- Work with string operations and arithmetic evaluation.
- Build a complete interactive application using only front-end tools.


## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- Add keyboard input support.
- Improve expression validation to avoid syntax errors.
- Add dark/light theme toggle.
- Support parentheses and operator precedence.
- Include percentage and square root functions.
